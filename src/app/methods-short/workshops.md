## Workshops
#### Description: 
-  In-person meetings (one hour to two days) that are informal, problem-solving focused, interactive, and often involve a combination of small group and plenary discussions.

#### Purpose:
-   Workshops provide marine resource managers and stakeholders with the opportunity to interact directly with each other in a small group format as well as in a standard, plenary format.

-   Workshops are useful spaces for brainstorming, sharing ideas, joint-problem solving, and trust and relationship building.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Medium
  - 	Workshops tend to be staff intensive events although the effort may only be required over 2-3 months. One marine resource manager, two to three support staff, and outside consultant assistance may be desired depending on the scope and scale of the event. 
-	Funding: Medium (assuming conducting more than one workshop around the state)
  -  Likely will require use of external contractors.
  -  Hiring a consultant to plan and facilitate a full-day workshop can range from $5,000-10,000. 
 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Process design and large and small group facilitation skills are preferable.

-   Logistics and event planning expertise is beneficial. 


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
