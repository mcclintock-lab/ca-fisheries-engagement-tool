## Workshops
#### Description: 
-  In-person meetings (one hour to two days) that are informal, problem-solving focused, interactive, and often involve a combination of small group and plenary discussions.

#### Purpose:
-   Workshops provide fisheries managers and stakeholders with the opportunity to interact directly with each other in a small group format as well as in a standard, plenary format.

-   Workshops are useful spaces for brainstorming, sharing ideas, joint-problem solving, and building trust and relationships.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Medium
  - 	Workshops tend to be staff intensive events although the effort may only be required over 2-3 months. One fisheries manager, two to three support staff, and outside consultant assistance may be desired depending on the scope and scale of the event. 
-	Funding: Medium (assuming conducting more than one workshop around the state)
  - 	Likely will require use of external contractors.
  - 	Hiring a consultant to plan and facilitate a full-day workshop can range from $5,000-10,000. 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Process design and large and small group facilitation skills are preferable.
-	Logistics and event planning expertise is beneficial.
