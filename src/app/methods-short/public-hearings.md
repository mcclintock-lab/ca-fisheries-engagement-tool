## Public Hearings/Oral Testimony
#### Description: 
-  Public hearings are opportunities for members of the public to provide oral testimony at formal public meetings or as part of a regulatory process.

#### Purpose:
-   Public hearings provide fisheries managers or agency staff with a formal spoken record on a regulatory process.

-   They provide stakeholders with a formal opportunity to provide input to inform management decisions.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?

  -  Medium (if external facilitation is required)


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
