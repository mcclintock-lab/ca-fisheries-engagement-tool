## Public Hearings/Oral Testimony
#### Description: 
-  Public hearings are opportunities for members of the public to provide oral testimony at formal public meetings or as part of a regulatory process.

#### Purpose:
-  Public hearings provide marine resource managers or agency staff with a formal spoken record on a regulatory process.

-  They provide stakeholders with a formal opportunity to provide input to inform management decisions.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Medium
  -   Public hearings require a minimum of one lead staffer or project/regulatory lead, one support staff member, one certified court reporter, and one facilitator to implement the meeting.
  -   Fish & Game Commission meetings need one additional marine resource manager to make presentations or answer questions.

-	Budget: Depends on whether external facilitation is needed and how many meetings are involved.
  -  Low (if a single meeting and if convened and facilitated by an existing Board or Commission)
  -  Medium (if multiple meetings and external facilitation is required)


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Facilitation 
-   Stenography
-   Event planning and logistics support


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
