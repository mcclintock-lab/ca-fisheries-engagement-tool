## Fishery Associations Meetings

a.  *Description*: Managers attend fishery association meetings convened
    by industry associations or recreational fishers to make
    announcements and meet stakeholders. Association meetings usually
    involve their membership, but may also include the broader
    fishing community.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Attending association meetings provides fisheries managers with the
    opportunity to present and share information directly to
    fishery users.

-   Managers can receive input from fishery users in an environment
    where they are likely to share information more freely than in a
    venue with more conflicting interests present (e.g., an
    advisory group).

-   Attending association meetings is an efficient method for meeting
    fishermen face-to-face and building relationships.
