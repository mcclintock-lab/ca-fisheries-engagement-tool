## Fishery Associations Meetings
#### Description: 
-  Managers attend marine resource association meetings convened by industry associations or recreational marine resource users to make announcements and meet stakeholders. Association meetings usually involve their membership, but may also include the broader resource user community.

#### Purpose:
-   Attending association meetings provides marine resource managers with the opportunity to present and share information directly to resource users.

-   Managers can receive input from resource users in an environment where they are likely to share information more freely than in a venue with more conflicting interests present (e.g., an advisory group).

-   Attending association meetings is an efficient method for meeting marine resource users face-to-face and building relationships.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: Low
  -   2-3% PY depending on the number of meetings, including presentation development and attendance. 
  -   Marine resource association meetings are often 1-3 hours and take place close to the docks.
-   Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   Deep contextual understanding of the relevant fishery, including biological and socioeconomic information and regulatory context. 

#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-   Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-   Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
