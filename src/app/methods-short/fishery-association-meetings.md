## Fishery Associations Meetings
#### Description: 
- Managers attend fishery association meetings convened by industry associations or recreational fishers to make announcements and meet stakeholders. Association meetings usually involve their membership, but may also include the broader fishing community. 

#### Purpose:
-   Attending association meetings provides fisheries managers with the opportunity to present and share information directly to fishery users.

-   Managers can receive input from fishery users in an environment where they are likely to share information more freely than in a venue with more conflicting interests present (e.g., an advisory group).

-   Attending association meetings is an efficient method for meeting fishermen face-to-face and building relationships.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: Low
  -   2-3% PY depending on the number of meetings, including presentation development and attendance. 
  -   Fishery association meetings are often 1-3 hours and take place close to the docks.
-   Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   In-depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management, and economic background of the process question.
-   Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may not align with the agency.
