## Written Public Comment
#### Description: 
-  Written public comment is an opportunity for members of the public to provide input (e.g., via email, letter, or website) on draft policy and regulatory documents. This can take place as part of a formal regulatory process; resource managers can also solicit written comments on draft materials or concepts in the pre-regulatory phase. 

#### Purpose:
-   Public comment provides marine resource managers or agency staff with a formal written record of public opinion on a regulatory process.

-   Public comment provides stakeholders with an opportunity to provide input to inform management decisions, both early in planning processes and during formal regulatory processes.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low to Medium
  -   Staff time for written public comment is entirely dependent on the number of comments received and on whether marine resource managers plan to or are required to respond to the comments (this acknowledges that agencies cannot always respond to all comments). For large scale or contentious processes, consider dedicating at least 10% PY. This includes development and maintenance of a comment catalogue system database. 
  -   At a minimum, one staffer or project/regulatory lead and one support staff or consultant to manage, catalogue, and respond to public comments as they come in. Resource managers often contract these services out to an outside consulting firm. 

-	Budget: Medium (assuming work is contracted out)
  -  For larger projects, likely will require use of external consultant.
  -  Assumes consultant would manage, catalogue, and respond to public comments as they come in.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-  Analytical skills to synthesize and respond to public comments.  

#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
