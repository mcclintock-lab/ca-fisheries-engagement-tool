## Written Public Comment


a.  *Description*: Written public comment is an opportunity for members
    of the public to provide input (e.g., via email, letter, or website)
    on draft policy and regulatory documents. This can take place as
    part of a formal regulatory process; resource managers can also
    solicit written comments on draft materials or concepts in the
    pre-regulatory phase.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Public comment provides fisheries managers or agency staff with a
    formal written record of public opinion on a regulatory process.

-   Public comment provides stakeholders with an opportunity to provide
    input to inform management decisions, both early in planning
    processes and during formal regulatory processes as well.
