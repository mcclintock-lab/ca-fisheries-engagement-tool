## Open House
#### Description: 
- Open houses are often structured in an open-floor format with different ‘stations’ placed around a large room. Stakeholders may engage in dialogue with content experts and provide comment as desired

#### Purpose:
-   Individual stakeholders interact directly with agency staff and build relationships with decisionmakers. 

-   Agency staff have the opportunity to learn stakeholder issues and key concerns. 

-   Interested marine resource stakeholders become more knowledgeable about a specific rulemaking process.


#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -  5% staff PY.  
  -  3-15 staff to participate in the event itself, including their travel costs.

-	Budget: Low
  -  $1,000 for materials.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the current rulemaking processes by participating staff.

-  Facilitation and process design skills for setting up and managing the open house room format.  

-  Oral communication and interpersonal skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
