## Trade Shows
#### Description: 
-  Trade shows are periodic events (typically annual) that bring together gear suppliers and fishermen (commercial and recreational). Agency staff can host a booth at trade shows to disseminate general information about and increase visibility of agency structure, process, and activities.

#### Purpose:
-   Trade show booths can be used to target underrepresented stakeholder groups in conversation, distribute information about agency processes, and generally build trust and visibility among the general public. They are a good opportunity for agency staff to engage in informal, one-on-one discussion with interested fishermen.
