## Trade Shows
#### Description: 
-  Trade shows are periodic events (typically annual) that bring together gear suppliers and resource users (commercial and recreational). Agency staff can host a booth at trade shows to disseminate general information about and increase visibility of agency structure, process, and activities. 

#### Purpose:
-   Trade show booths can be used to target underrepresented stakeholder groups in conversation, distribute information about agency processes, and generally build trust and visibility among the general public. They are a good opportunity for agency staff to engage in informal, one-on-one discussion with interested resource users.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -   2-3% staff PY to plan and attend trade shows, depending on frequency.
-	Budget: Low
  -   $500-3,000 for travel costs for staff, depending on location, any communication materials for dissemination and booth banners.


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	The ability to effectively engage trade show attendees.
-   Oral communication and interpersonal skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
