## Conference Calls
#### Description: 
- Managers engage a group of stakeholders remotely via telephone.

#### Purpose:
-   Conference calls facilitate two-way dialogue between marine resource managers and stakeholders.
-   They provide an efficient and accessible method of engagement by reducing the cost and travel time for participants. 

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -    Less than 1% PY.
  -    At a minimum, one staff person required to convene and lead the calls, with additional staff support as needed.

-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Facilitation skills desired, but not required

#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
