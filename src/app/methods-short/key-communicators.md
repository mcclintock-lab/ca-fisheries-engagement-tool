## Key Communicators
#### Description: 
-  Managers work with key members (usually leaders) of a marine resource community and other stakeholder groups as nodes for building trust, communicating with other participants within their marine resource community about management processes, and providing critical feedback on management options.

#### Purpose:
-  By disseminating information to key communicators and requesting they distribute it to their representative communities, key communicators can help build relationships and ensure resource management information is distributed to and received from key stakeholders. Key communicators provide a means of engaging hard-to-reach marine resource groups: they speak the same language as users; have established, positive relationships within the particular resource community; and are sometimes seen as being able to speak for the resource in question.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?

-  Staffing: Low (variable effort: depends on the project and how often communication is needed)
  -  At least one agency staff member per fishery who is aware of the relevant key communicators for that fishery and maintains contact with them throughout the management process.
-  Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   Direct management and implementation knowledge of the marine resource management issue.

-   Deep contextual understanding of the relevant fishery, including biological and socioeconomic information and regulatory context.

-   Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may not align with the agency.

-   Ability to foster and maintain informal and formal relationships with diverse people.

-   Management-level responsibilities are beneficial, as communicators will likely want to know if the staff they speak to can make decisions based on the feedback they receive.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
