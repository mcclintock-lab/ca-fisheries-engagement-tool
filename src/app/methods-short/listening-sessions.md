## Listening Sessions

a.  *Description*: Listening sessions are in-person meetings between
    managers and stakeholders focused on providing a venue for
    stakeholders to voice their interests and concerns. Managers are
    present primarily in a listening (rather than
    information presentation) capacity.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Listening sessions help managers get a pulse on the range of options
    for crafting management alternatives, potentially identify creative
    management opportunities by introducing new perspectives, and
    elevate the voices of underrepresented stakeholder groups.
