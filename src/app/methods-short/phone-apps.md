## Applications (Phone Apps)
#### Description: 
-  Phone applications provide cell phone users with a method to input information about marine resource conditions and catch, or to quickly and efficiently receive information. 

#### Purpose:
-   Phone apps provide a fast and easy method for managers to collect real-time data about resource collection, marine resource conditions, and socioeconomic and demographic information.
-   Managers can use apps to disseminate timely information about updated resource regulations, current rulemaking processes, and other relevant information. 

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -	Minimal staff capacity (1-5% PY) to draft relevant notifications and maintain app.
-	Budget: Medium
  -	$5,000-25,000 upfront costs to create the app, possibly using other state management agency apps as a template.
  -	Likely will require use of external contractors unless in-house programming skills exist.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the current rulemaking processes or relevant agency activities by participating staff and ability to tailor communications for the app interface.
-	Clear and concise written messaging and timely communication skills.
-	Significant in-house computer programming skills (or hiring of external contractors) to develop the app or adapt a template from other state resource agencies.

#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
