## Applications (Phone Apps)
#### Description: 
-  Phone applications provide cell phone users with a method to input information about fishing conditions and catch, or to quickly and efficiently receive information.

#### Purpose:
-   Phone apps provide a fast and easy method for managers to collect real-time data about fish catch, fishery conditions, and demographic information such as socio-economics.
-   Managers can also use apps to disseminate timely information about updated fishery regulations, current rulemaking processes, and other relevant information. These near real-time updates may increase compliance with existing rules and regulations.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -	Minimal staff capacity (1-5% PY) to draft relevant notifications and maintain app.
-	Budget: Medium
  -	$5,000-25,000 upfront costs to create the app, possibly using other state management agency apps as a template.
  -	Likely will require use of external contractors.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the current rulemaking processes or relevant agency activities by participating staff and ability to tailor communications for the app interface.
-	Clear and concise written messaging and timely communication skills.
-	Significant computer programming skills to develop the app or adapt a template from other state resource agencies
