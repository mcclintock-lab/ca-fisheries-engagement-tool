## Applications (Phone Apps)

a.  *Description:* Phone applications provide cell phone users with a
    method to input information about fishing conditions and catch, or
    to quickly and efficiently receive information.

b.  *Purpose: *

    -   Phone apps provide a fast and easy method for managers to
        collect real-time data about fish catch, fishery conditions, and
        demographic information such as socio-economics.

    -   Managers can also use apps to disseminate timely information
        about updated fishery regulations, current rulemaking processes,
        and other relevant information. These near real-time updates may
        increase compliance with existing rules and regulations.
