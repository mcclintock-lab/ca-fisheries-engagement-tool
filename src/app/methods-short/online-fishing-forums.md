## Online Fishing Forums
#### Description: 
- Online forums are similar to social media feeds targeted to a specific interest group. Proactive participation in forums allows staff to virtually meet stakeholders to exchange ideas and build an understanding of stakeholder interests. 

#### Purpose:
-   Online forums provide a venue to increase the visibility of management staff, promote agency messaging within trusted channels, and limit the proliferation of unclear or inaccurate information.

-	Staffing: Low
  -	 1-10% staff PY depending on forum activity.
-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?

#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious?

In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith?
