## Polling
#### Description: 
-  Polling samples or collects opinions on a subject, taken from either a selected or a random group of stakeholders. Polling can be done through a survey or real time using mobile devices (mobile polling).

#### Purpose:
-   Polling is similar to surveys but with a greater level of specificity (usually a single or small number of questions). The purpose of a poll is to solicit input on a specific issue quickly.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  - 	2-4 hours to design, implement, and compile results of a poll.
  - 	1 staffer to design and implement the poll (for electronic/web-based polls). Multiple staffers may be needed if polls are carried out in the field. 
-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the process or issue in question.

-   Familiarity with online survey design tools (e.g., SurveyMonkey) or mobile polling applications.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
