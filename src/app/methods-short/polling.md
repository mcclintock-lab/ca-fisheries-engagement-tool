## Polling
#### Description: 
-  Polling samples or collects opinions on a subject, taken from either a selected or a random group of stakeholders. Polling can be done through a survey or real time using mobile phone devices (mobile polling).

#### Purpose:
-   Polling is similar to surveys (see below) but with a greater level of specificity (usually a single question). The purpose of a poll is to solicit input on a specific issue quickly.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  - 	2-4 hours to design, implement, and compile results of a poll.
  - 	1 staffer to design and implement the poll (for electronic/web-based polls). Multiple staffers may be needed if polls are carried out in the field. 
-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the process in question by participating staff.
-	Familiarity with survey design tools like SurveyMonkey (online) or mobile polling applications.

#### Question 3: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 

#### Question 4: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
