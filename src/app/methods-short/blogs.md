## Blogs
#### Description: 
- Blogs are an internet-based method for writing informally about management status and processes. Managers use blogs to share information and ideas.

#### Purpose:
-  Managers can use this forum as an online Frequently Asked Questions message board, increase the visibility of management staff perspectives, and highlight current management interests and concerns. 
-  Stakeholders can use blogs to highlight their own perspectives, and share information, updates, and ideas about the marine resource.

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts?
