## Social Media
#### Description: 
-  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, and YouTube are online social media tools that can be used to inform a large number of people (beyond those on existing listservs) of key information and increase the visibility of managers among specific stakeholder groups. 

#### Purpose:
-   Social media is a low-cost and efficient method for reaching a large number of people, including marine resource stakeholders who may be underrepresented in other engagement processes or the general public. 

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -   1-5% staff PY to maintain social media accounts, respond to comments, and manage dialogue. 
-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of social media platforms. Ability to design and post timely messages that reflect agency perspectives and values. 
-  Clear and concise written communication skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
