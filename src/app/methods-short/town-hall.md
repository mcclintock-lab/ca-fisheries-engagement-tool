## Town Hall-Style Meetings
#### Description: 
-  Town hall-style meetings are open, public meetings often structured around a brief presentation on a specific topic followed by time for questions and discussion. 

#### Purpose:
-   Town halls give stakeholders an opportunity to speak freely about a specific or general issue of management concern. They can also be structured to disseminate information to a geographically-specific stakeholder community. They are helpful during rulemaking processes or while implementing a management policy, as a means of disseminating information and clarifying uncertainties among geographically-specific communities.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -   3-5% staff PY to plan and implement the town hall.
  -   1-2 additional staff to participate in the event itself.

-	Budget: Low
  -   $500 for travel costs for staff, depending on location, and any meeting materials.
  -   Additional costs may be required for venues.


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Strong process design and facilitation skills.

-   Knowledge of the current rulemaking processes by participating staff.

-   Oral communication and interpersonal skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
