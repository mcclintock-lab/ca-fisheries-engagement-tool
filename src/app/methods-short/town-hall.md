## Town Hall-Style Meetings

    a.  *Description*: Different from listening sessions, town halls are
        open, public meetings often structured around a brief
        presentation on a specific topic followed by time for questions.

    b.  *Purpose*:

-   Town halls give stakeholders an opportunity to speak freely about a
    specific or general issue of management concern. They can also be
    structured to disseminate information to a geographically-specific
    stakeholder community.
