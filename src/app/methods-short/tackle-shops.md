## Tackle Shops and Fuel Dock Information Sharing

    a.  *Description*: Tackle shops are private businesses that may be
        frequented by both recreational and commercial fishermen. They
        are located throughout the California coast. Management
        information in the form of flyers or brochures can be placed at
        the check-out counter or storefront of tackle shops to
        disseminate details to stakeholders that are not
        electronically connected. : Fuel docks are private businesses
        that are commonly frequented by both recreational and
        commercial fishermen. They are located at ports and marinas
        along the California coast. Management information in the form
        of flyers or brochures can be posted and disseminated at fuel
        docks to reach stakeholders that may not be
        electronically connected.

    b.  *Purpose*:

-   Distribute timely information efficiently to a broad
    stakeholder audience. Sharing messages in this fashion is
    particularly helpful when the stakeholder groups are undefined,
    speak a different language, or are difficult to reach using
    electronic methods.
