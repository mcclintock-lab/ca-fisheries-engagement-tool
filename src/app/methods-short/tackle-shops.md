## Tackle Shops and Fuel Dock Information Sharing
#### Description: 
-  Tackle shops are private businesses that may be frequented by both recreational and commercial fishermen. They are located throughout the California coast. Management information in the form of flyers or brochures can be placed at the check-out counter or storefront of tackle shops to disseminate details to stakeholders that are not electronically connected. Fuel docks are private businesses that are commonly frequented by both recreational and commercial fishermen. They are located at ports and marinas along the California coast. Management information in the form of flyers or brochures can be posted and disseminated at fuel docks to reach stakeholders that may not be electronically connected.

#### Purpose:
-   Distribute timely information efficiently to a broad stakeholder audience. Sharing messages in this fashion is particularly helpful when the stakeholder groups are undefined, speak a different language, or are difficult to reach using electronic methods. 

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: Low
  -   1-5% staff PY to develop, vet and distribute flyers.
-   Budget: Low
  -   $100-1,000 to print flyers.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   Agency staff must have the ability to design and post timely messages that reflect agency perspectives and values. 

-  Visual and graphic design skills.

-  Clear and concise written communication skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
