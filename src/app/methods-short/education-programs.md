## Education Programs

a.  *Description*: Education programs train stakeholders to build their
    understanding of the management process and capacity to engage in
    scoping or revising management rules. Education programs are often
    multiple day intensives where key leaders, youth, or particularly
    active stakeholders are trained in how to engage effectively and in
    management processes more generally (e.g., rulemaking 101), and
    given the opportunity to socialize with other stakeholders and
    agency staff.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Education programs aim to increase long-term engagement of key
    fishery stakeholders, foster leadership among fishery stakeholders,
    and build relationships between stakeholders and managers.
