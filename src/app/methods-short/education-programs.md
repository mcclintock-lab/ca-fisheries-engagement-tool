## Education Programs
#### Description: 
- Education programs train stakeholders and increase their understandings of the management process and capacity to engage in scoping or revising management rules. Education programs can occur over a single or multiple days with the goal of training key stakeholders in how to engage effectively, participate in management processes more generally (e.g., rulemaking 101), and where attendees are given the opportunity to socialize with other stakeholders and agency staff.

#### Purpose:
-   Education programs increase stakeholder understandings of management and engagement processes and thereby better equip them to more fully participate in dialogues about the resource and take on leadership roles.

In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts?

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
