## Surveys
#### Description: 
-  An evaluation or information collection technique consisting of a series of questions designed to solicit opinions from stakeholders on specific fisheries management issues and/or to collect data (e.g., human dimensions of the fishery or otherwise). Surveys can be distributed online (e.g., using tools like SurveyMonkey) or via hard copy (to be completed in-person or mailed by the respondent at a later date).

#### Purpose:
-   Surveys solicit input on a specific topic, such as evaluating the socioeconomic demographics of a fishery or soliciting feedback on a proposal for a management alternative, from a targeted list of stakeholders.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  - 	4-16 hours to design, implement, and compile the results of a survey (depending on the complexity and target audience of the survey).
- 	Budget: Low
  - 	While some online survey tools are free, a Surveymonkey Pro account costs between $300 and $500 per year. 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the fishery management issue by participating staff.
-	Expertise in crafting appropriate (e.g., non-leading) survey questions.
-	Familiarity with survey design tools like SurveyMonkey (for online surveys).
