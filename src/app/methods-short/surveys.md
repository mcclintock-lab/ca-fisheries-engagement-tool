## Surveys
#### Description: 
-  An evaluation or information collection technique consisting of a series of questions designed to solicit opinions from stakeholders on specific marine resource management issues and/or to collect data (e.g., human dimensions of the resource or otherwise). Surveys can be distributed online (e.g., using tools like SurveyMonkey) or via hard copy (to be completed in-person or mailed by the respondent at a later date).

#### Purpose:
-   Surveys solicit input on a specific topic, such as evaluating the socioeconomic demographics of a marine resource or soliciting feedback on a proposal for a management alternative, from a targeted list of stakeholders. 

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -    4-16 hours to design, implement, and compile the results of a survey (depending on the complexity and target audience of the survey).
- 	Budget: Low
  - 	While some online survey tools are free, a Surveymonkey Pro account costs between $300 and $500 per year. 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the marine resource management issue by participating staff.

-   Expertise in crafting appropriate (e.g., non-leading) survey questions.

-   Familiarity with survey design tools like SurveyMonkey (for online surveys).


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
