## Informal Meet-and-greet Meetings
#### Description: 
- Small group or one-on-one discussions between marine resource managers and stakeholders, often located in public establishments close to the docks.

#### Purpose:
-   Meet-and-greets provide marine resource managers with the opportunity to build personal relationships with individual marine resource users in an informal environment.
-   They allow marine resource stakeholders to share concerns and input with marine resource managers in an informal environment.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low (per meeting)
  -	 One staffer per meeting, with additional staff support as needed
-	Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Comfort engaging with individuals who may not agree with or may be outwardly hostile towards a particular management or regulatory decision.
-   Networking.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
