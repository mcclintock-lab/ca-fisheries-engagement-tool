## Collaborative Fisheries Research

a.  *Description*: Managers, researchers, and fishermen co-design and
    co-conduct research to assess fishery status or test a
    management option. Note that the engagement component of
    collaborative fisheries research is secondary to the primary purpose
    of conducting research.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Collaborative fisheries research evaluates hypotheses around the
    efficacy of various management alternatives or tests specific
    management-relevant technology.

-   Collaborative research serves to engage fishery stakeholders with
    relevant context or expertise in a rigorous and intensive process of
    formulating research questions and executing research design, thus
    fostering and building relationships and trust in the process.

-   Collaborative research increases buy-in and ownership of the
    decision-making process, increases transparency around the use of
    data in decision-making, improves the valuation of scientific
    information in decision-making, and motivates co-development of
    management goals.
