## Collaborative Fisheries Research
#### Description: 
- Managers, researchers, and fishermen co-design and co-conduct research to assess marine resource status or test a management option. Note that the engagement component of collaborative fisheries research is secondary to the primary purpose of conducting research. 

#### Purpose:
-   Collaborative fisheries research evaluates hypotheses around the efficacy of various management alternatives or tests specific management-relevant technology. 
-   Collaborative research serves to engage marine resource stakeholders with relevant context or expertise in a rigorous and intensive process of formulating research questions and executing research design, thus fostering and building relationships and trust in the process. 
-   Collaborative research increases buy-in and ownership of the decision-making process, increases transparency around the use of data in decision-making, improves the valuation of scientific information in decision-making, and motivates co-development of management goals.


#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: High
  -  >1 full-time staff member to help design and manage the research collaboration. 30% staff PY to analyze, translate, and communicate the research results.
-   Budget: High
  -   May require use of external contractors.
  -   Depends on lab and monitoring equipment and processes required.


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   Research design and implementation skills.
-   Project and team management skills.
-   Research-appropriate analysis and communication skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
