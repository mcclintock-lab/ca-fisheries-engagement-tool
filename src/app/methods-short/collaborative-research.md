## Collaborative Fisheries Research
#### Description: 
- Managers, researchers, and fishermen co-design and co-conduct research to assess fishery status or test a management option. Note that the engagement component of collaborative fisheries research is secondary to the primary purpose of conducting research.

#### Purpose:
-   Collaborative fisheries research evaluates hypotheses around the efficacy of various management alternatives or tests specific management-relevant technology.

-   Collaborative research serves to engage fishery stakeholders with relevant context or expertise in a rigorous and intensive process of formulating research questions and executing research design, thus fostering and building relationships and trust in the process.

-   Collaborative research increases buy-in and ownership of the decision-making process, increases transparency around the use of data in decision-making, improves the valuation of scientific information in decision-making, and motivates co-development of management goals.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: High
  -  More than 1 full-time staff member to help design and manage the research collaboration. 30% staff PY to analyze, translate, and communicate the research results.
-   Budget: High
  -   Likely will require use of external contractors.
  -   More than $500 for research supplies, depending on the research question and design.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   Research design and implementation skills.
-   Project and team management skills.
-   Research-appropriate analysis and communication skills.
