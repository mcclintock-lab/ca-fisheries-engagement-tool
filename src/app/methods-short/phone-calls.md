## Phone Calls

a.  *Description*: Phone calls are an opportunity for fisheries managers
    to communicate orally with individual stakeholders via telephone.
    These may be initiated by the fisheries manager or the stakeholder.

b.  *Purpose*:

    -   Phone calls provide fisheries managers or agency staff with an
        informal opportunity to reach out directly to individual
        stakeholders to ask questions, receive input, and
        build relationships.

    -   Phone calls initiate two-way communication to test ideas on
        sensitive subjects: this may be useful in cases where
        stakeholders or fisheries managers donâ€™t feel comfortable
        creating a written record.
