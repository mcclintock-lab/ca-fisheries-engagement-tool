## Phone Calls
#### Description: 
-  Phone calls are an opportunity for fisheries managers to communicate orally with individual stakeholders via telephone. These may be initiated by the fisheries manager or the stakeholder.

#### Purpose:
-   Phone calls provide fisheries managers or agency staff with an informal opportunity to reach out directly to individual stakeholders to ask questions, receive input, and build relationships.

-   Phone calls initiate two-way communication to test ideas on sensitive subjects: this may be useful in cases where stakeholders or fisheries managers donâ€™t feel comfortable creating a written record.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: Low (requirements are variable depending on communication needs)
-   Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
