## Co-management Regimes
#### Description: 
-  Co-management describes a situation whereby marine resource management agencies share joint institutional responsibility and authority for managing a resource with other governmental entities (e.g., tribes) or stakeholders. 

#### Purpose:
-   Co-management guarantees marine resource users a direct role in the decision-making process around regulations affecting the resource.
-   Co-management helps build trust and relationships between marine resource management agencies and other governmental entities or stakeholders.


#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: High
  - 	Co-management can be labor intensive for staff, although this needs to be weighed against the opportunity cost of managing the marine resource in an alternative format.
-	Budget: High
  - 	Likely will require use of external contractors.


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	In-depth knowledge of marine resource management and science for the particular resource is important, as well as a significant understanding of MLMA and other marine resource regulations more generally.
-   Significant large and small group facilitation skills are preferable.
-   Logistics and event planning expertise is beneficial. 
-   Collaborative and joint problem-solving skills.


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
