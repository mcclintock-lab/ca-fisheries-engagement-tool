## Co-management Regimes
#### Description: 
-  Co-management is when fisheries management agencies share joint institutional responsibility and authority for managing a fishery with other governmental entities (e.g., tribes) or stakeholders.

#### Purpose:
-   Co-management guarantees fishery users a direct role in the
    decision-making process around regulations affecting the fishery.

-   Co-management helps build trust and relationships between fisheries
    management agencies and other governmental entities or stakeholders.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: High
  - 	Co-management can be labor intensive for staff, although this needs to be weighed against the opportunity cost of managing the fishery in an alternative format.
-	Budget: High
  - 	Likely will require use of external contractors.


#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	In-depth knowledge of fisheries management and science for the particular fishery is important, as well as a significant understanding of MLMA and other fisheries regulations more generally.
-	Significant large and small group facilitation skills are preferable.
-	Logistics and event planning expertise is beneficial. 
-	Collaborative and joint problem-solving skills.
