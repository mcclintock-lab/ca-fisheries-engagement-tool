## Press Releases
#### Description: 
- Written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media to announce something newsworthy (often a major project milestone or regulatory decision).

#### Purpose:
-   Press releases reach a broad audience quickly, inform members of the public about a major decision or milestone, and target individuals who may not otherwise be aware of marine resource management. Publications carrying releases typically have a broader customer base than agency listservs.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  -   1-2 hours of staff time to help draft and review the press release.
  -   3-5 hours of staff time to have the release reviewed internally and distributed. 
  -   One Public Information Officer to draft and finalize the press release (usually already part of their job responsibilities)

-	Budget: Low
  -   Depending on the media outlet used, there may be a cost associated with the release being posted. Distribution services such as PR Newswire charge a fee; contacting individual outlets directly generally do not. 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the marine resource management issue by participating staff.
-   Familiarity with release distribution services like PR Newswire and Business Wire (common for Public Information Officers).


#### Question 3: Is the current management process highly contentious? 
-  Note: In some cases, highly contentious stakeholder processes are best addressed using in-person strategies. In others, or when litigation is currently underway or highly likely, you may be restricted in the strategies you employ (in this case, you will want to consult with CDFW communications personnel for additional information and resources). 

#### Question 4: How effective has this strategy been in previous marine resource management efforts? 
-  Based on your past experience with this community of stakeholders, do participants in your outreach process have the desire and ability to participate in good faith? 

#### Question 5: Are any stakeholder engagement strategies required by statute (consult with CDFW legal as needed)?
