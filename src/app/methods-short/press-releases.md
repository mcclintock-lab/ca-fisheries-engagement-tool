## Press Releases
#### Description: 
- Written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media to announce something newsworthy (often a major project milestone or regulatory decision).

#### Purpose:
-   Press releases reach a broad audience quickly, inform members of the public about a major decision or milestone, and target individuals who may not otherwise be aware of fisheries issues, as publications carrying releases have a broader customer base than agency list serves.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-	Staffing: Low
  - 	0.5-1 hour of staff time to help draft and review the press release.
  - 	5 hours of staff time to have the release reviewed internally and distributed. 
  - 	One public information officer to draft and finalize the press release (usually already part of their job responsibilities)
-	Budget: Low
  - 	Depending on the media outlet used, there may be a cost associated with the release being posted. Distribution services such as PR Newswire charge a fee; contacting individual outlets directly generally do not. 

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-	Knowledge of the fishery management issue by participating staff.
-	Familiarity with release distribution services like PR Newswire and Business Wire.
