## Stakeholder Advisory Groups (standing or ad hoc)
#### Description: 
-  Stakeholder advisory groups are multi-interest bodies of appointed stakeholders convened for a pre-determined period of time to provide advice to a decision-making body. Stakeholder advisory groups can serve to identify key issues, generate management alternatives, or liaise between managers and advisory group constituencies. They typically have charters describing their core charge and participants, and they can meet once or multiple times. 

-  There are two kinds of stakeholder advisory group:
  -  Standing stakeholder advisory groups:
        i.  Typically focused on a particular fishery.
        ii. Typically meet at set intervals throughout a year.
        iii. Formalized, rotating membership.
  -   Ad hoc stakeholder advisory groups:
        i.  Typically focused on a particular policy, planning, or regulatory issue.
        ii. Typically convened for multiple meetings. May range from a few months to multiple years.
        iii. Can involve parties outside of fishing interests.

#### Purpose:
-   For either ad hoc or standing advisory groups, the purpose is to solicit input from a group of individuals representative of larger interest groups (i.e., environmental NGOs, fishing industry, regulators, etc.) collaboratively to support development of solutions to policy challenges.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?
-   Staffing: High
  -    Staffing assignments are largely dependent on the size of the group in question. For smaller advisory groups, a single staff member, one support staff, and one group facilitator may be sufficient. Larger groups may require additional staff to support group activities. 
-   Budget: High (assuming at least 4 Advisory Group meetings)
  -    Cost will depend on the number of meetings and the complexity of the advisory process. 
  -    Third party neutral, professional facilitation is critical.

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?
-   In depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management, and economic background of the fishery management issue.
-   Facilitation and mediation experience (note: in contentious cases, third-party neutral facilitation is advised).
-   Event planning or logistics support experience is beneficial.
