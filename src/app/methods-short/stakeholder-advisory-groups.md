## Stakeholder Advisory Groups (standing or ad hoc)

a.  *Description*: Stakeholder advisory groups are multi-interest bodies
    > of appointed stakeholders convened for a pre-determined period of
    > time to provide advice to a decision-making body. Stakeholder
    > advisory groups can serve to identify key issues, generate
    > management alternatives, or liaise between managers and advisory
    > group constituencies. They typically have charters describing
    > their core charge and participants, and they can meet once or
    > multiple times. There are two kinds of stakeholder advisory group:

    -   Standing stakeholder advisory groups:

        i.  Typically focused on a particular fishery.

        ii. Typically meet at set intervals throughout a year.

        iii. Formalized, rotating membership.

    -   Ad hoc stakeholder advisory groups:

        i.  Typically focused on a particular policy, planning, or
            regulatory issue.

        ii. Typically convened for multiple meetings. May range from a
            few months to multiple years.

        iii. Can involve parties outside of fishing interests.

b.  *Purpose*:

    -   For either ad hoc or standing advisory groups, the purpose is to
        solicit input from a group of individuals representative of
        larger interest groups (i.e., environmental NGOs, fishing
        industry, regulators, etc.) collaboratively to support
        development of solutions to policy challenges.
