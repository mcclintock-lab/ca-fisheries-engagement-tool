## Surveys
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  The approach to developing survey questions is not meant to be overly prescriptive; in some cases, questions with easily quantifiable answers may be preferred to more open-ended, qualitative questions. However, in many cases qualitative questions may provide richer responses to specific questions. 

-  Questions should be as specific as possible to solicit desired information. Often times, multiple choice or “rating” questions are easier to analyze, especially if using an online platform. 

-  The same staff member should review all survey responses to ensure consistent interpretation of data. If this is not practical, the same staff member should review all responses to a given question or range of questions.


#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
-  Monitor the survey response rate and the distribution channels that have the most response returns.
