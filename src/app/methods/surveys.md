## Surveys

a.  *Description*: An evaluation or information collection technique
    > consisting of a series of questions designed to solicit opinions
    > from stakeholders on specific fisheries management issues and/or
    > to collect data (e.g., human dimensions of the fishery
    > or otherwise). Surveys can be distributed online (e.g., using
    > tools like SurveyMonkey) or via hard copy (to be completed
    > in-person or mailed by the respondent at a later date).

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Surveys solicit input on a specific topic, such as evaluating the
    socioeconomic demographics of a fishery or soliciting feedback on a
    proposal for a management alternative, from a targeted list
    of stakeholders.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   During implementation

-   Provided on an ongoing basis to solicit input on a specific aspect
    of fisheries management

a.  *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low

    -   4-16 hours to design, implement, and compile the results of a
        survey (depending on the complexity and target audience of
        the survey).

-   Budget: Low

    -   While some online survey tools are free, a Surveymonkey Pro
        account costs between \$300 and \$500 per year.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Knowledge of the fishery management issue by participating staff.

-   Expertise in crafting appropriate (e.g., non-leading)
    survey questions.

-   Familiarity with survey design tools like SurveyMonkey (for
    online surveys).

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   The approach to developing survey questions is not meant to be
    overly prescriptive: in some cases, questions with easily
    quantifiable answers may be preferred to more open-ended,
    qualitative questions. However, in many cases qualitative questions
    may provide richer responses to specific questions.

-   Questions should be as specific as possible to solicit
    desired information. Often times, multiple choice or “rating”
    questions are easier to analyze, especially if using an online
    platform such as Surveymonkey.

-   The same staff member should review all survey responses to ensure
    consistent interpretation of data.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Monitor the survey response rate and the distribution channels that
    have the most response returns.
