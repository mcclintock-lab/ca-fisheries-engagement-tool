## Press Releases

a.  *Description*: Written or recorded communication directed at
    members of the news media to announce something newsworthy
    (often a major project milestone or regulatory decision).

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Press releases reach a broad audience quickly, inform members of
    the public about a major decision or milestone, and target
    individuals who may not otherwise be aware of fisheries issues,
    as publications carrying releases have a broader customer base
    than agency list serves.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   During implementation

-   Provided on an ongoing basis to solicit input on a series of
    rulemakings or to build trust among stakeholders

a.  *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low

-   0.5-1 hour of staff time to help draft and review the
    press release.

-   5 hours of staff time to have the release reviewed internally
    and distributed.

-   One public information officer to draft and finalize the press
    release (usually already part of their job responsibilities)

-   Budget: Low

-   Depending on the media outlet used, there may be a cost
    associated with the release being posted. Distribution services
    such as PR Newswire charge a fee; contacting individual outlets
    directly generally do not.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Knowledge of the fishery management issue by
    participating staff.

-   Familiarity with release distribution services like PR Newswire
    and Business Wire.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Press releases should be distributed between 1 week and 3 days
    in advance of any event or major decision announcement.

-   Press releases must be posted to news distribution services or
    media outlets before press deadlines at least the day before the
    desired release date, but not more than 2 days before.

-   Press releases should include the purpose of the release in the
    headline with basic information (who, what, where, when,
    and why) in the body of the text. Links can be provided to more
    detailed information as needed.

-   If the target outlet is a specific local publication, agency
    staff must contact the writer covering the area of interest
    (i.e., natural resources, politics, local news, etc.) directly
    to pitch the story.

-   Press releases reach only those that consistently read target
    news outlets and only communicate a specific message. As such,
    they need to be supplemented by other engagement strategies that
    provide opportunities for more engaging or
    story-based messaging.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Monitor the number of publications that run the story.

-   Review publications to see where the release appears in the
    printed version. Particularly for newspapers, the release’s
    physical location in the publication (e.g., “above the fold”) is
    almost as important as whether or not it appears at all.
