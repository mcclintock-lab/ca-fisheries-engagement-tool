## Press Releases
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Press releases should be distributed between 1 week and 3 days in advance of any event or major decision announcement.

- Press releases must be posted to news distribution services or media outlets before press deadlines at least the day before the desired release date, but not more than 2 days before.

- Press releases should include the purpose of the release in the headline with basic information (who, what, where, when, and why) in the body of the text. Links can be provided to more detailed information as needed.

- If the target outlet is a specific local publication, agency staff must contact the writer covering the area of interest (i.e., natural resources, politics, local news, etc.) directly to pitch the story.

- Press releases reach only those that consistently read target news outlets and only communicate a specific message. As such, they need to be supplemented by other engagement strategies that provide opportunities for more engaging or story-based messaging.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Monitor the number of publications that run the story.

- Review publications to see where the release appears in the printed version. Particularly for newspapers, the release’s physical location in the publication (e.g., “above the fold”) is almost as important as whether or not it appears at all.
