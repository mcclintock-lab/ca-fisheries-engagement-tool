## Newsletters
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  Agency staff use engaging visuals and stories to communicate their messages. 
-  A clear and timely vetting process is established within the agency to review and edit the newsletter in advance of sending. 
-  When appropriate, agency staff pair the newsletter release with messaging about ‘untraditional’ engagement processes (e.g., visioning meetings) that will draw attention and readership. 

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
-  Use software (e.g., Gov Delivery) to monitor newsletter use (e.g., whether or not stakeholders open the newsletter and which links they click for follow-up information).
