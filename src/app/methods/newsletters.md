## Newsletters (electronic)

a.  *Description*: Electronic newsletters can be used to disseminate
    information to a large number of stakeholders in a formal and
    consistent manner.

b.  *Purpose*:

    -   Newsletters communicate a message to a large number of
        stakeholders (e.g., upcoming management changes or
        rulemaking processes).

c.  *Timing*:

    -   Newsletters can be appropriate at any point in the
        management process.

d.  *Required resources:*

-   Staffing: Low

    -   5-10% staff FTE to draft, vet, and send newsletters on a
        consistent, as-needed basis, and to maintain and update the
        newsletter list serve contacts.

-   Budget: Low

a.  *Required skills*:

    -   The ability to design and post timely messages that reflect
        agency perspectives and values.

    -   Clear and concise written communication skills.

    -   Thorough understanding of agency formatting and review protocols

b.  *Keys to success*:

    -   Agency staff use engaging visuals and stories to communicate
        their messages.

    -   A clear and timely vetting process is established within the
        agency to review and edit the newsletter in advance of sending.

    -   Agency staff, when appropriate, pair the newsletter release with
        messaging about ‘untraditional’ engagement processes (e.g.,
        visioning meetings) that will draw attention and readership.

c.  *Evaluation*:

    -   Use software (e.g., Gov Delivery) to monitor newsletter use
        (e.g., whether or not stakeholders open the newsletter and which
        links they click for follow-up information).
