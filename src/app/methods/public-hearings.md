## Public Hearings
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Developing a clear facilitation plan document is critical for the success of public hearings and public testimony. At a minimum, these documents should outline:
  - Staff roles and responsibilities

  - Tightly managed timeframes for each agenda item

  - Clearly defined time limits for each public commenter

  - Step-by-step instructions for the public comment portion of the meeting, including (but not limited to) who will handle microphones, how the facilitator will keep time, and how or whether staff will provide responses to comments during the meeting

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Count the number of oral comments received at a meeting.
