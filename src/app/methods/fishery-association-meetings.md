## Fishery Association Meetings
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Developing relationships with key communicators and fishery leaders within a particular fishing sector can be critical for ensuring agency staff are well-received during association meetings. These relationships can also be nurtured at association meetings.

- Entering into an environment where many stakeholders may not be supportive of fisheries management regulation can be challenging for agency staff unaccustomed to managing difficult relationships. Managers utilizing this engagement method should be comfortable interacting in these types of environments.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Track relationships built through participation in fishery association meetings (e.g., development of new key communicators).

- Use surveys to evaluate whether agency staff participation in a meeting was appreciated and viewed as time well spent by their membership.
