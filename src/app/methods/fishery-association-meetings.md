## Fishery Associations Meetings

a.  *Description*: Managers attend fishery association meetings convened
    by industry associations or recreational fishers to make
    announcements and meet stakeholders. Association meetings usually
    involve their membership, but may also include the broader
    fishing community.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Attending association meetings provides fisheries managers with the
    opportunity to present and share information directly to
    fishery users.

-   Managers can receive input from fishery users in an environment
    where they are likely to share information more freely than in a
    venue with more conflicting interests present (e.g., an
    advisory group).

-   Attending association meetings is an efficient method for meeting
    fishermen face-to-face and building relationships.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   During program implementation

-   During ongoing program activities in anticipation of future policy
    or regulatory changes

a.  *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low

    -   2-3% FTE depending on the number of meetings, including
        presentation development and attendance.

    -   Fishery association meetings are often 1-3 hours and take place
        close to the docks.

-   Budget: Low

a.  *Required skills*:

-   In-depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management,
    and economic background of the process question.

-   Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may
    not align with the agency.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Developing relationships with key communicators and fishery leaders
    within a particular fishing sector can be critical for ensuring
    agency staff are well-received during association meetings. These
    relationships can also be nurtured at association meetings.

-   Entering into an environment where many stakeholders may not be
    supportive of fisheries management regulation can be challenging for
    agency staff unaccustomed to managing difficult relationships.
    Managers utilizing this engagement method should be comfortable
    interacting in these types of environments.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Track relationships built through participation in fishery
    association meetings (e.g., development of new key communicators).

-   Use surveys to evaluate whether agency staff participation in a
    meeting was appreciated and viewed as time well spent by
    their membership.
