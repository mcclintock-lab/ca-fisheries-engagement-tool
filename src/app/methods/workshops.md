## Workshops
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  A well-developed facilitation plan is important for clearly defining all staff roles and responsibilities. 

-  Workshops should generally be advertised (via target listservs, key communicators, and other methods) at least three weeks in advance. Outreach reminders tend to be helpful in boosting attendance.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
-  Use surveys of participants to evaluate the efficacy of facilitation, changes in perception of the agency, and what information participants are taking away.
