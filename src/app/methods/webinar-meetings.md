## Webinar Meetings
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  Spotlight or engage agency leadership in webinars to promote visibility and trust-building among interested stakeholders. 

-  Stream public meetings through a webinar format to efficiently increase viewership and accessibility of meetings to underrepresented stakeholders (e.g., by mitigating travel costs).

-  Use engaging visuals and outline talking points ahead of time. 

-  To the extent possible, use interactivity to engage the audience, including polling, small-group breakouts if the software supports this functionality, or virtual ‘roundtables.’

-  Ensure that electronic networks have the bandwidth to support webinars. Large webinars may require high bandwidth; any internet problems on the host’s end result in significant latency issues and a negative user experience. 

-  To the extent possible, record webinars are provide on website for future viewing by interested stakeholders that were unable to participate at the scheduled time.


#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
-  Monitor the number of participants on each webinar. 

-  Monitor the number of questions and comments raised on each webinar to evaluate the level of engagement, as well as any follow-ups (e.g., email, phone calls). 

-  Use surveys to evaluate changes in participants’ perceptions of the topic of the webinar or of the agency.
