## Webinar Meetings

a.  *Description: Webinars are virtual meetings with auditory and visual
    components that allow participants to share information and dialogue
    across distances. *

b.  *Purpose: *

-   Webinars can be used to communicate management options early in the
    rulemaking process, educate stakeholders about a particular issue,
    or electronically stream public meetings. More advanced webinars
    utilizing platforms such as Adobe Connect allow for breakout groups,
    instant polling, and other innovative tools to provide a high degree
    of stakeholder input and collaboration in virtual meetings.

a.  *Timing: *

-   Webinars can be appropriate at any point in the management process.

a.  *Required resources:*

-   Staffing: Low

    -   5% staff FTE to design, market, and manage a quarterly webinar,
        plus staff time for individual presentation development and
        implementation per webinar.

-   Budget: Low

    -   \$300-1,000 for webinar software program subscriptions

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Clear and articulate verbal communication skills.

-   Process design, facilitation and technical skills for managing a
    virtual group of stakeholders.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Agency staff spotlight or engage agency leadership in webinars to
    promote visibility and trust-building among interested stakeholders.

-   Agency staff stream public meetings through a webinar format to
    efficiently increase viewership and accessibility of meetings to
    underrepresented stakeholders (e.g., by mitigating travel costs).

-   Agency staff use engaging visuals and outline talking points ahead
    of time.

-   To the extent possible, agency staff use interactivity to engage the
    audience, including polling, small-group breakouts if the software
    supports this functionality, or virtual ‘roundtables.’

-   Agency staff or consultants must ensure their electronic networks
    have the bandwidth to support webinars. Large webinars may require
    high bandwidth; any internet problems on the host’s end result in
    significant latency issues and a negative user experience.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Monitor the number of participants on each webinar.

-   Monitor the number of questions and comments raised on each webinar
    to evaluate the level of engagement, as well as any follow-ups
    (e.g., email, phone calls).

-   Use surveys to evaluate changes in participants’ perceptions of the
    topic of the webinar or of the agency.
