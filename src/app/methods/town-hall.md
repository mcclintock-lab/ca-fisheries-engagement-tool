## Town Hall-Style Meetings

    a.  *Description*: Different from listening sessions, town halls are
        open, public meetings often structured around a brief
        presentation on a specific topic followed by time for questions.

    b.  *Purpose*:

    specific or general issue of management concern. They can also be
    structured to disseminate information to a geographically-specific
    stakeholder community.

    a.  *Timing: *

-   Town hall meetings are best used during a rulemaking process or
    while implementing a management policy to disseminate information
    and clarify uncertainties among geographically-specific communities.
