## Stakeholder Advisory Groups
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  Third-party, neutral facilitation can be immensely helpful in achieving consensus and efficient decision-making in advisory group settings. This allows agency staff to focus on their role as marine resource managers without also trying to manage group dynamics or give the appearance of being allied with one side or another in a policy dispute. 

-  Stakeholder advisory groups can be labor intensive, relatively expensive, and require a significant commitment on the part of both marine resource managers and the stakeholder participants. Therefore, clear roles and commitments need to be established at the onset of the process to streamline engagement (e.g., with a Charter).

-  For long standing advisory groups or committees, it is important that as stakeholder membership shifts and new members come into the group, they agree not to re-open previously closed discussions barring any significant physical or regulatory changes impacting the resource. This provides the existing membership with assurances that existing agreements wonâ€™t be jeopardized if a new stakeholder joins the group. 


#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:

-  Evaluate whether the advisory group achieved the desired objectives in the time allotted. This can be done with mid-course or post-process survey evaluations.

-	Review whether all deliverables and assignments (by staff and stakeholders) are completed on time and on budget.

-	Survey participants to evaluate the fairness and efficacy of group facilitation and their perceptions of the process.
