## Key Communicators
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
-  Agency staff that establish relationships with key communicators remain the point of contact for that person over time to sustain trust. 
-  To identify key communicators, start by asking members of the marine resource community who they go to for information about the resource. 
-  Do not assume that by engaging key communicators, the entire marine resource community is heard or represented. Key communicators may still represent the majority and minority voices must be engaged individually. 

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
-  Use surveys of key communicators to evaluate their perceptions of the agency over time. 
-  Use surveys within the broader marine resource community to determine if information passed to key communicators is being effectively disseminated.
