## Key Communicators

a.  *Description*: Managers work with key members (usually leaders) of a
    fishing community and other stakeholder groups as nodes for building
    trust, communicating with other participants within their fisheries
    about management processes, and providing critical feedback on
    management options.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Leveraging key communicators provides fisheries managers or agency
    staff with the opportunity to build close relationships with leaders
    in a particular fishery.

-   Key communicators provide a means of engaging hard-to-reach fishery
    groups: they speak the same language as users; have established,
    positive relationships within the particular fishing community; and
    are sometimes seen as being able to speak for the fishery
    in question.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   During program implementation

-   During ongoing program activities

a.  *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low (variable effort: depends on the project and how often
    communication is needed)

    -   One staffer on point

-   Budget: Low

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Direct management and implementation knowledge of the fishery
    management issue.

-   In depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management,
    and economic background of the process question.

-   Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may
    not align with the agency.

-   Ability to foster and maintain informal and formal relationships
    with diverse people.

-   Management-level responsibilities are beneficial, as communicators
    will likely want to know if the staff they speak to can make
    decisions based on the feedback they receive.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Agency staff that establish relationships with key communicators
    remain the point of contact for that person over time to
    sustain trust.

-   To identify key communicators, start by asking members of the
    fishing community who they go to for information about the fishery.

-   Do not assume that by engaging key communicators, the entire fishing
    community is heard or represented. Key communicators may still
    represent the majority and minority voices must be
    engaged individually.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Use surveys of key communicators to evaluate their perceptions of
    the agency over time.
