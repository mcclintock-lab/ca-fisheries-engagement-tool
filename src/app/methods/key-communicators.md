## Key Communicators
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Agency staff that establish relationships with key communicators remain the point of contact for that person over time to sustain trust.

- To identify key communicators, start by asking members of the fishing community who they go to for information about the fishery.

- Do not assume that by engaging key communicators, the entire fishing community is heard or represented. Key communicators may still represent the majority and minority voices must be engaged individually.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Use surveys of key communicators to evaluate their perceptions of the agency over time.
