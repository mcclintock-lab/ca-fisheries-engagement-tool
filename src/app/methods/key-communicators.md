## Key Communicators
#### Description: 
-  Managers work with key members (usually leaders) of a fishing community and other stakeholder groups as nodes for building trust, communicating with other partici
pants within their fisheries about management processes, and providing critical feedback on management options.

#### Purpose:
-  Leveraging key communicators provides fisheries managers or agency staff with the opportunity to build close relationships with leaders in a particular fishery.
-  Key communicators provide a means of engaging hard-to-reach fishery groups: they speak the same language as users; have established, positive relationships within the particular fishing community; and are sometimes seen as being able to speak for the fishery in question.

#### Question 1: How did this strategy perform with regard to your priority goals and the expert ratings?
-  See table above for your priority goals and expert ratings

#### Question 2: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?

-  Staffing: Low (variable effort: depends on the project and how often communication is needed)
  -  One staffer on point
-  Budget: Low

#### Question 3: Where are you in your management process (timing)?

#### Question 4: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?

-  Direct management and implementation knowledge of the fishery management issue.

-  In depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management, and economic background of the process question.

-  Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may not align with the agency.

-  Ability to foster and maintain informal and formal relationships with diverse people.

-  Management-level responsibilities are beneficial, as communicators will likely want to know if the staff they speak to can make decisions based on the feedback they receive.

#### Question 5: What other keys to success are involved in effectively implementing this strategy?

-  Agency staff that establish relationships with key communicators remain the point of contact for that person over time to sustain trust.

-  To identify key communicators, start by asking members of the fishing community who they go to for information about the fishery.

-  Do not assume that by engaging key communicators, the entire fishing community is heard or represented. Key communicators may still represent the majority and minority voices must be engaged individually.

#### Question 6: What methods can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy?

-  Use surveys of key communicators to evaluate their perceptions of the agency over time.
