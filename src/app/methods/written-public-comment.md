## Written Public Comment


a.  *Description*: Written public comment is an opportunity for members
    of the public to provide input (e.g., via email, letter, or website)
    on draft policy and regulatory documents. This can take place as
    part of a formal regulatory process; resource managers can also
    solicit written comments on draft materials or concepts in the
    pre-regulatory phase.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Public comment provides fisheries managers or agency staff with a
    formal written record of public opinion on a regulatory process.

-   Public comment provides stakeholders with an opportunity to provide
    input to inform management decisions, both early in planning
    processes and during formal regulatory processes as well.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning, and during the formal regulatory process.

a.  *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low to Medium

    -   Staff time for written public comment is entirely dependent on
        the number of comments received and on whether fisheries
        managers plan to or are required to respond to the comments
        (this acknowledges that agencies cannot always respond to
        all comments). For large scale or contentious processes,
        consider dedicating at least 10% FTE. This includes development
        and maintenance of a comment catalogue system database.

    -   At a minimum, one staffer or project/regulatory lead and one
        support staff or consultant to manage, catalogue, and respond to
        public comments as they come in. Resource managers often
        contract these services out to an outside consulting firm.

-   Budget: Medium (assuming work is contracted out)

    -   For larger projects, likely will require use of
        external consultant.

    -   Assumes consultant would manage, catalogue, and respond to
        public comments as they come in.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Analytical skills to synthesize public comments.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Provide the public with sufficient time to review the draft
    decision documents.

-   For complex issues, provide a comment guide to facilitate
    preparation of written comments.

-   Set clear expectations as to whether and how agency staff will be
    responding to individual comments and to how the agency will be
    addressing and incorporating the comments received.

-   Encourage original written comments (as opposed to form letters).

a.  *Legal considerations*:

-   The MLMA requires that the Department post proposed plans, plan
    amendments, hearing schedules, and agendas on the Department website
    and stakeholders must have the chance to review and submit comments
    on the management plan. When involved in the peer review process,
    the Department is required to make all comments made by stakeholders
    available to the peer review panel.[^2]

-   CEQA requires that the public be allowed time to comment on the
    reports and the effects the project may have on the environment.
    These comments must be sought and received early and often
    throughout the project planning process to afford timely
    identification of the potential effects of the project, means for
    mitigation, and any possible alternatives.[^3] The Department and
    Commission must allow at least 45 days for public review of a
    negative declaration[^4] or environmental impact report.[^5] After
    comments are submitted, the lead agency must take the comments into
    consideration and make revisions accordingly.[^6]

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Count the number of original comments received.
