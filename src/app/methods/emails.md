    may also contain attached documents. Recipients may range from
    individuals to large groups of stakeholders accessed via a listserv.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Personal emails to key individuals can help build relationships and
    create two-way dialogue between active fishery participants
    and managers.

    disseminate timely information to a targeted audience.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Emails can be used to circulate relevant or timely information to
    individual stakeholders at any point in the decision-making process,
    or on an ad hoc basis.
