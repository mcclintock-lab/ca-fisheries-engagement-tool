## Collaborative Research
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Allow sufficient time and resources to collaboratively design and implement research, including training stakeholders without previous experience with target methodologies.

- Create a culture of open communication and transparency, particularly around research assumptions and concerns, but also around results and findings.

- Craft feasible and outcome-oriented goals for the research.

- Ensure that there is money and time to translate and communicate the results to all collaborators and their respective communities in appropriate formats.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Monitor whether participants ask for or disseminate the research findings, indicating their valuation of the data.

- Track how participants follow-up (e.g., email, phone) to make observations or continue discussion about the research.

- Use surveys to evaluate changes in how participants perceive management processes, consider scientific information, or trust in managers.
