## Phone Apps
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Agency staff tailor the app to marine resource stakeholders. 

- Agency staff actively use the app to push out relevant information to users and gather information and data from fishery participants. 


#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Monitor the number of downloads.
- Monitor the frequency and consistency of usage. 
- Monitor number of infractions before and after launching the app.
- Use surveys to evaluate how stakeholders use the app and how their perceptions of management may change as a result of app access. NOTE: These can be short surveys built into the app itself.
