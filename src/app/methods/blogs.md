## Blogs 
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Agency staff link other online resources (website, social media, etc.) to blog posts to increase visibility. 
- Agency staff use an informal, clear voice and employ stories to connect with readers. 
- Agency staff can refer stakeholders to relevant and popular information on past blog posts, replacing the need for individual emails.
- Agency staff establish a clear and timely vetting process to review and edit the newsletter in advance of sending. 

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Use Google Analytics to monitor traffic to the blog over time, identify the issues or questions most relevant to readers, and pinpoint which resources readers most often link to (e.g., identify the additional information readers seek while reading the blog post, to help predict and tailor information for future posts).
