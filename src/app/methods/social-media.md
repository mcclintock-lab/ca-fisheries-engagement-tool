## Social Media
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Agency staff that use their own names and identifying characteristics help humanize agency activities and create champions within the stakeholder community that will voluntarily moderate online discussions among users with different perspectives.

- Agency staff streamline messaging across departments, including the connectivity between division or region-specific pages.

- Agency staff use engaging visuals and stories to communicate.

- Agency staff deploy social media tools to allow disparate perspectives to emerge on various social media threads. This allows stakeholders to see the diversity of opinions managers need to consider publicly and can help manage expectations around management outcomes.

- Agency staff refer to existing state and federal guidelines for building and maintaining government social media presence.

- Agency leaders invite social media representatives to train staff in using social media (e.g., Facebookâ€™s Start to Success Program).

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Monitor social media using the online tools designed to do so (e.g., Tweetreach).

- Use surveys to evaluate changes in attitudes towards the agency or use of agency social media.
