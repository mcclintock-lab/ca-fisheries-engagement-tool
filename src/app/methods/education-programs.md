## Education Programs
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Invite and incorporate trusted speakers from across stakeholder groups and agency leadership; invite a member of the stakeholder community as the keynote speaker.

- If the goal is to build trust and relationships, the program is best implemented over 2-4 days to ensure adequate time for socializing and group cohesion.

- Provide scholarships to emerging leaders or key communicators within target fisheries to motivate or facilitate participation.

- Ensure adequate representation across stakeholder or fisher groups to help build bridges across different perspectives and backgrounds.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Use surveys to evaluate changes in how stakeholders engage before and after the education program.

- Monitor the engagement of stakeholders who have participated in programs compared with those who have not.
