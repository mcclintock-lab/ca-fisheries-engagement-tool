## Education Programs

a.  *Description*: Education programs train stakeholders to build their
    understanding of the management process and capacity to engage in
    scoping or revising management rules. Education programs are often
    multiple day intensives where key leaders, youth, or particularly
    active stakeholders are trained in how to engage effectively and in
    management processes more generally (e.g., rulemaking 101), and
    given the opportunity to socialize with other stakeholders and
    agency staff.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Education programs aim to increase long-term engagement of key
    fishery stakeholders, foster leadership among fishery stakeholders,
    and build relationships between stakeholders and managers.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Education programs are most appropriate in the early stages of
    planning or decision-making, as they seek to proactively train
    stakeholders to engage later in the process.

-   Education programs can also be helpful for motivating engagement on
    an ongoing basis.

a.  *Required resources:*

-   Staffing: Low

    -   At least 1 full-time staff member to develop, implement and
        manage the educational aspects of agency
        decision-making processes.

    -   &gt;30% staff FTE to support and co-facilitate the full-time
        lead staff member.

-   Budget: Low

    -   \$5,000-100,000 depending on facility needs, curriculum
        development, and scholarship opportunities offered
        to participants.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Process design and facilitation skills.

-   Curriculum development, training, and project management skills.

-   Clear and concise written and oral communication skills.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Invite and incorporate trusted speakers from across stakeholder
    groups and agency leadership; invite a member of the stakeholder
    community as the keynote speaker.

-   If the goal is to build trust and relationships, the program is best
    implemented over 2-4 days to ensure adequate time for socializing
    and group cohesion.

-   Provide scholarships to emerging leaders or key communicators within
    target fisheries to motivate or facilitate participation.

-   Ensure adequate representation across stakeholder or fisher groups
    to help build bridges across different perspectives and backgrounds.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Use surveys to evaluate changes in how stakeholders engage before
    and after the education program.

-   Monitor the engagement of stakeholders who have participated in
    programs compared with those who have not.
