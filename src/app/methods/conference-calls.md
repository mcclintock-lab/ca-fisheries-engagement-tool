## Conference Calls

-   *Description*: Managers engage a group of stakeholders remotely
    via telephone.

-   *Purpose*:

-   Conference calls facilitate two-way dialogue between fisheries
    managers and stakeholders.

-   They provide an efficient and accessible method of engagement by
    reducing the cost and travel time for participants.

-   *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   Throughout project implementation

-   As part of ongoing engagement throughout the life of a project or
    regulation

-   *Required resources*:

-   Staffing: Low

    -   Less than 1% FTE.

    -   At a minimum, one staff person required to convene and lead the
        calls, with additional staff support as needed.

-   Budget: Low

-   *Required skills*:

-   Large group facilitation skills are desired, but not required

-   *Keys to success*:

-   Clear understanding of teleconference “ground rules” (i.e., avoid
    putting people on “hold,” speak clearly and concisely, mute when not
    speaking, etc.) is essential for a successful teleconference.

-   Teleconferences are generally most suitable for groups of 10 or
    less, but can be adapted to reach dozens or hundreds of
    people simultaneously.

-   Teleconferences suffer from a lack of “visual cues.” As such, they
    are better suited for sharing information rather than negotiation or
    conflict resolution.

-   *Evaluation*:

-   Use surveys to evaluate how stakeholders perceived the utility of
    the call to become informed about a fishery issue.
