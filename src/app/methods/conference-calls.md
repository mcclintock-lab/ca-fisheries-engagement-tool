## Conference Calls
#### The following keys to success should be considered if you choose to implement this strategy:
- Clear understanding of teleconference “ground rules” (i.e., avoid putting people on “hold,” speak clearly and concisely, mute when not speaking, etc.) is essential for a successful teleconference.

- Teleconferences are generally most suitable for groups of 10 or less, but can be adapted to reach dozens or hundreds of people simultaneously.

- Teleconferences suffer from a lack of “visual cues.” As such, they are better suited for sharing information rather than negotiation or conflict resolution.

#### The following methods are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy:
- Use surveys to evaluate how stakeholders perceived the utility of the call to become informed about a fishery issue.
