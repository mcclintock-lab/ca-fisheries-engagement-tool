## Listening Sessions

a.  *Description*: Listening sessions are in-person meetings between
    managers and stakeholders focused on providing a venue for
    stakeholders to voice their interests and concerns. Managers are
    present primarily in a listening (rather than
    information presentation) capacity.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Listening sessions help managers get a pulse on the range of options
    for crafting management alternatives, potentially identify creative
    management opportunities by introducing new perspectives, and
    elevate the voices of underrepresented stakeholder groups.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Listening sessions are most appropriate in the early stages of
    planning or decision-making because they help identify priority
    interests and concerns that can guide the formation of
    management alternatives. However, listening sessions can be used
    throughout management processes to ascertain key stakeholder
    interests and provide a space for stakeholders to voice concerns.

a.  *Required resources:*

-   Staffing: Low

    -   5% staff FTE to design and implement.

    -   1-3 additional staff to participate in the event itself (1-2
        hours per session).

-   Budget: Low

    -   \$2,000 for facilitation materials and travel costs for staff.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Process design and facilitation skills.

-   Oral communication and interpersonal skills.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Agency staff craft these meetings to be deliberative
    and transparent.

-   Agency staff target communities that are not reached during public
    hearings and which have a range of active stakeholder groups.

-   Ensure information presented to stakeholders during the session is
    designed to solicit input on desired issues/questions instead of
    fisheries’ management generally.

-   Agency staff distribute flyers and emails marketing the open
    house widely. Staff ensure that the open house receives publicity
    from sources stakeholders’ trust.

-   Agency staff hold listening sessions throughout the entire affected
    geographic area to ensure that stakeholder participation is not
    limited by travel costs.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Monitor the number of individuals who attend.

-   Monitor the number of written comments or feedback received.

-   Consider asking participants to complete a short survey before
    leaving to collect feedback on the format and efficacy of the
    listening session.
