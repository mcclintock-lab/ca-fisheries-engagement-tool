    id: "efficient",
    header: "Work within Stakeholder Constraints",
    description: "Are the affected community’s resources (e.g., availability to participate in stakeholder engagement activities or the financial resources to participate) limited? If any of these are true, then addressing limitations in stakeholder participation capabilities may be especially important, and this goal should be considered a high priority."

    id: "educate",
    header: "Educate Stakeholders about the Decision-Making Process",
    description: "Often stakeholders are not aware of how decisions are made for resource management. Educating stakeholders about the decision-making process boosts their capacity to inform management, minimizes confusion or misinformation about the regulatory process, and leads to cross-cutting, sustained trust building between stakeholders and managers."

    description: "Particularly in the case of well-known marine resources with a history of management needs, engaging local communicators and community thought leaders can be a priority engagement goal."

    id: "engage-under-represented",
    header: "Engage Under-Represented Groups",
    description: "Stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process may vary significantly across resources and communities. Some user groups regularly engage with managers, while others are less involved or are reluctant to participate in formal engagement activities. In these cases, stakeholders and communities significantly impacted by a management decision may be under-represented in the decision-making process. Working directly with these stakeholders, particularly when they are affected by management of a specific resource (such as subsistence fishers), is critical."

    id: "social-research-on-fishery",
    header: "Socioeconomic Research on the Resource",
    description: "Often, little information is available on marine resource user communities. This can limit resource managers’ abilities to conduct effective outreach. Conducting socioeconomic research in conjunction with preferred stakeholder engagement strategies can produce essential information such as stakeholder definition, market value of the fishery, and user trends. Do you have sufficient information on the socioeconomic aspects of the marine resource stakeholders to effectively conduct outreach? If not, socioeconomic research may be a high priority goal."
