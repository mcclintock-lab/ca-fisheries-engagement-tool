    header: "Engage Stakeholders Efficiently",
    description: "If the resource is geographically diverse, or if resource managers and the affected community have limited resources to participate in a stakeholder process, a variety of engagement strategies can be employed to ensure stakeholders are kept informed of and engaged in the process in an efficient manner."

    id: "educate",
    header: "Educate Stakeholders about the Decision-Making Process",
    description: "Often stakeholders are not aware of how decisions are made for resource management. Educating stakeholders about the decision-making process boosts their capacity to inform management, minimizes confusion or misinformation about the regulatory process, and leads to cross-cutting, sustained trust building between stakeholders and managers."

    header: "Engage Under-Represented Groups",
    description: "In some instances, the stakeholders and communities significantly impacted by a management decision may be underrepresented in the decision-making process or reluctant to participate in formal engagement activities. Working directly with these stakeholders, particularly when they are affected by management of a specific resource (such as subsistence fishers) is critical."

    description: "New and emerging resources develop with regularity in California. In some cases, particularly with respect to small fisheries, little information on resource users may be available. Likewise, even for established resources, resource managers may not have the information necessary to conduct effective outreach. Conducting social research through direct engagement can produce essential resource information such as stakeholder definition, market value of a resource, and user trends."
