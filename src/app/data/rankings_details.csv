Phone Applications,Phone applications provide a means for one-way communication (from stakeholder to fishery manager or vice versa) on set topics. This type of information gathering and sharing is useful but it is not relational and does not create conditions to build trust. ,Phone applications provide a low-cost means to gather input or share information on set topics with a large stakeholder base with minimal effort once the application is developed. ,Phone applications are only used to gather input on topic-specific questions or share limited information; they are typically not used to educate stakeholders on how to participate in a management decision process. ,The lack of face-to-face communication does not create the conditions needed to build relationships with key communicators.  ,"Phone applications typically do not create the conditions needed to engage economically, culturally, or linguistically diverse groups of stakeholders.

Webinar meetings,"Webinars are more effective at building trust where an existing base of trust exists rather than developing initial trust.

Collaborative Fisheries Research,"Collaborative fisheries research relies on a close partnership between fishery users and managers, and by its nature engenders a high level of trust.  ", Collaborative fisheries research is time consuming and costly. ,"The high level of coordination between fishery users and managers needed for collaborative fisheries research requires that all participants have a very detailed understanding of roles and responsibilities in the research and decision making processes.

Because this strategy includes stakeholders as peers in the decision making process, a high level of trust is inherent in its implementation. ",Co-management regimes can take a long time to put into place and will not be appropriate for all fisheries. ,"Since stakeholders are peers with fisheries managers in this strategy, they quickly become educated on how to participate directly in management decisions. ","In order to successfully co-manage a fishery, key stakeholders and managers must invest significant resources in building close relationships with each other.

Key communicators are often those that are advising other stakeholders of processes, serving as liaisons, or even participating in education programs to teach stakeholders and advocate for engagement capacity building.","Building relationships is the primary focus of the key communicators strategy.

Listening Sessions,"Since this strategy involves 1-way communication (stakeholders provide input to managers with no expectation of collaboration) it often does not build trust, especially if there is already a condition of distrust in the community. However, since it can involve managers seeking input directly from the affected community in situations where they may feel not heard, it can help build trust in those situations. ","Listening sessions provide an effective means of rapidly engaging and soliciting input from a large audience. Given limited resources of many fisheries users, fishermen may not be able to attend time-intensive listening sessions. ","Listening sessions are designed to receive information from stakeholders, rather than disseminate information or educate stakeholders.","Listening sessions provide an opportunity for fishery stakeholders to interact with a manager, but are not specifically designed to provide solutions and may, especially those with a plenary comment period, simply provide an echo chamber for detractors to amplify their concerns on a fishery management issue.
