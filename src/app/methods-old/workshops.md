## Workshops

a.  *Description*: In-person meetings (one hour to two days) that are
    informal, problem-solving focused, interactive, and often involve a
    combination of small group and plenary discussions.

b.  *Purpose: *

-   Workshops provide fisheries managers and stakeholders with the
    opportunity to interact directly with each other in a small group
    format as well as in a standard, plenary format.

-   Workshops are useful spaces for brainstorming, sharing ideas,
    joint-problem solving, and building trust and relationships.

a.  *Timing: *

-   Early or late planning

-   As part of ongoing engagement throughout the life of a project or
    regulation

a.  *Required resources: *

-   Staffing: Medium

    -   Workshops tend to be staff intensive events although the effort
        may only be required over 2-3 months. One fisheries manager, two
        to three support staff, and outside consultant assistance may be
        desired depending on the scope and scale of the event.

-   Funding: Medium (assuming conducting more than one workshop around
    the state)

    -   Likely will require use of external contractors.

    -   Hiring a consultant to plan and facilitate a full-day workshop
        can range from \$5,000-10,000.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Process design and large and small group facilitation skills
    are preferable.

-   Logistics and event planning expertise is beneficial.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   A well-developed facilitation plan is important for clearly defining
    all staff roles and responsibilities.

-   Workshops should generally be noticed (via target listservs, key
    communicators, and other methods discussed above) at least three
    weeks in advance. Outreach reminders tend to be helpful in
    boosting attendance.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Use surveys of participants to evaluate the efficacy of
    facilitation, changes in perception of the agency, and what
    information participants are taking away.
