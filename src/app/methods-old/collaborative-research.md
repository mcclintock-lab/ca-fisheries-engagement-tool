## Collaborative Fisheries Research

a.  *Description*: Managers, researchers, and fishermen co-design and
    co-conduct research to assess fishery status or test a
    management option. Note that the engagement component of
    collaborative fisheries research is secondary to the primary purpose
    of conducting research.

b.  *Purpose*:

-   Collaborative fisheries research evaluates hypotheses around the
    efficacy of various management alternatives or tests specific
    management-relevant technology.

-   Collaborative research serves to engage fishery stakeholders with
    relevant context or expertise in a rigorous and intensive process of
    formulating research questions and executing research design, thus
    fostering and building relationships and trust in the process.

-   Collaborative research increases buy-in and ownership of the
    decision-making process, increases transparency around the use of
    data in decision-making, improves the valuation of scientific
    information in decision-making, and motivates co-development of
    management goals.

a.  *Timing*:

-   Collaborative research is most appropriate in the early stages of
    planning or decision-making, as it explicitly seeks to generate
    knowledge and information relevant to the creation of management
    options and the weighing of management alternatives.

-   Collaborative research can also be used to inform ongoing
    management needs.

a.  *Required resources:*

-   Staffing: High

    -   &gt;1 full-time staff member to help design and manage the
        research collaboration. 30% staff FTE to analyze, translate, and
        communicate the research results.

-   Budget: High

    -   Likely will require use of external contractors.

    -   &gt;\$500 for research supplies, depending on the research
        question and design.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Research design and implementation skills.

-   Project and team management skills.

-   Research-appropriate analysis and communication skills.

a.  *Keys to success*:

-   Allow sufficient time and resources to collaboratively design and
    implement research, including training stakeholders without previous
    experience with target methodologies.

-   Create a culture of open communication and transparency,
    particularly around research assumptions and concerns, but also
    around results and findings.

-   Craft feasible and outcome-oriented goals for the research.

-   Ensure that there is money and time to translate and communicate the
    results to all collaborators and their respective communities in
    appropriate formats.

a.  *Evaluation*:

-   Monitor whether participants ask for or disseminate the research
    findings, indicating their valuation of the data.

-   Track how participants follow-up (e.g., email, phone) to make
    observations or continue discussion about the research.

-   Use surveys to evaluate changes in how participants perceive
    management processes, consider scientific information, or trust
    in managers.
