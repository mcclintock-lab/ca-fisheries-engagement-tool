## Trade Shows

a.  *Description: Trade shows are periodic events (typically annual)
    that bring together gear suppliers and fishermen (commercial
    and recreational). Agency staff can host a booth at trade shows to
    disseminate general information about and increase visibility of
    agency structure, process, and activities. *

b.  *Purpose: *

-   Trade show booths can be used to target underrepresented stakeholder
    groups in conversation, distribute information about agency
    processes, and generally build trust and visibility among the
    general public. They are a good opportunity for agency staff to
    engage in informal, one-on-one discussion with interested fishermen.

a.  *Timing: *

-   Agency presence at trade shows is appropriate at any point in the
    management process.
