## Key Communicators
#### Description: 
-  Managers work with key members (usually leaders) of a fishing community and other stakeholder groups as nodes for building trust, communicating with other partici
pants within their fisheries about management processes, and providing critical feedback on management options.

#### Purpose:
-  Leveraging key communicators provides fisheries managers or agency staff with the opportunity to build close relationships with leaders in a particular fishery.
-  Key communicators provide a means of engaging hard-to-reach fishery groups: they speak the same language as users; have established, positive relationships within the particular fishing community; and are sometimes seen as being able to speak for the fishery in question.

#### Question 1: What level of resources, both in terms of staffing and funding, are required for this strategy?

-  Staffing: Low (variable effort: depends on the project and how often communication is needed)
  -  One staffer on point
-  Budget: Low

#### Question 2: What skills are required by staff to effectively implement this strategy?

-  Direct management and implementation knowledge of the fishery management issue.

-  In depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory, management, and economic background of the process question.

-  Ability to reach out to and interact with groups whose interests may not align with the agency.

-  Ability to foster and maintain informal and formal relationships with diverse people.

-  Management-level responsibilities are beneficial, as communicators will likely want to know if the staff they speak to can make decisions based on the feedback they receive.
