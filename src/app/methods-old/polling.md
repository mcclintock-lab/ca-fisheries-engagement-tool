## Polling

a.  *Description*: Polling samples or collects opinions on a subject,
    > taken from either a selected or a random group of stakeholders.
    > Polling can be done through a survey or real time using mobile
    > phone devices (mobile polling).

b.  *Purpose*:

        level of specificity (usually a single question). The purpose of
        a poll is to solicit input on a specific issue quickly.

c.  *Timing*:

-   Early or late planning

-   During implementation

-   Provided on an ongoing basis to solicit input on a specific aspect
    of fisheries management

        electronic/web-based polls). Multiple staffers may be needed if
        polls are carried out in the field.

a.  *Required skills*:

-   Knowledge of the process in question by participating staff.

    mobile polling applications.
