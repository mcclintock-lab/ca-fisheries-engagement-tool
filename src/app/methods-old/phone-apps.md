## Applications (Phone Apps)

a.  *Description:* Phone applications provide cell phone users with a
    method to input information about fishing conditions and catch, or
    to quickly and efficiently receive information.

b.  *Purpose: *

    -   Phone apps provide a fast and easy method for managers to
        collect real-time data about fish catch, fishery conditions, and
        demographic information such as socio-economics.

    -   Managers can also use apps to disseminate timely information
        about updated fishery regulations, current rulemaking processes,
        and other relevant information. These near real-time updates may
        increase compliance with existing rules and regulations.

c.  *Timing*: Phone applications can be used to disseminate or solicit
    information at any point in the decision-making process, or on an ad
    hoc basis.

d.  *Required resources* *(annually)*:

-   Staffing: Low

    -   Minimal staff capacity (1-5% FTE) to draft relevant
        notifications and maintain app.

-   Budget: Medium

    -   \$5,000-25,000 upfront costs to create the app, possibly using
        other state management agency apps as a template.

    -   Likely will require use of external contractors.

a.  *Required skills*:

    -   Knowledge of the current rulemaking processes or relevant agency
        activities by participating staff and ability to tailor
        communications for the app interface.

    -   Clear and concise written messaging and timely
        communication skills.

    -   Significant computer programming skills to develop the app or
        adapt a template from other state resource agencies

b.  *Keys to success:*

    -   Agency staff tailor the app to fishery stakeholders through a
        high-quality user-centric design.

    -   Agency staff actively use the app to push out relevant
        information to users and gather information and data from
        fishery participants.

c.  *Evaluation: *

    -   Monitor the number of downloads.

    -   Monitor the frequency and consistency of usage.

    -   Monitor number of infractions before and after launching
        the app.

    -   Use surveys to evaluate how stakeholders use the app and how
        their perceptions of management may change as a result of
        app access.
