## Public Hearings/Oral Testimony

a.  *Description*: Public hearings are opportunities for members of the
    > public to provide oral testimony at formal public meetings or as
    > part of a regulatory process.

b.  *Purpose*:

    -   Public hearings provide fisheries managers or agency staff with
        a formal spoken record on a regulatory process.

    -   They provide stakeholders with a formal opportunity to provide
        input to inform management decisions.

c.  *Timing: *

    -   Early or late planning

d.  *Required resources*:

    -   Staffing: Medium

    <!-- -->

    -   Public hearings require a minimum of one lead staffer or
        project/regulatory lead, one support staff member, one certified
        court reporter, and one facilitator to implement the meeting.

    -   Fish & Game Commission meetings need one additional fisheries
        manager to make presentations or answer questions.

    <!-- -->

    -   Budget: Depends on whether external facilitation is needed.

        i.  Low (if convened and facilitated by an existing Board
            or Commission)

        ii. Medium (if external facilitation is required)

e.  *Required skills*:

    -   Large group facilitation

    -   Stenography

    -   Event planning and logistics support

f.  *Keys to success*:

    -   Developing a clear facilitation plan document is critical for
        the success of public hearings and public testimony. At a
        minimum, these documents should outline:

        i.  Staff roles and responsibilities

        ii. Tightly managed timeframes for each agenda item

        iii. Clearly defined time limits for each public commenter

        iv. Step-by-step instructions for the public comment portion of
            the meeting, including (but not limited to) who will handle
            microphones, how the facilitator will keep time, and how or
            whether staff will provide responses to comments during the
            meeting

g.  *Legal Considerations:*

    -   Public Hearings and official testimony is generally subject to
        open meeting laws and other administrative procedures/regulatory
        requirements as described in Figure 4.

h.  *Evaluation*:

    -   Count the number of oral comments received at a meeting.
