## Stakeholder Advisory Groups (standing or ad hoc)

a.  *Description*: Stakeholder advisory groups are multi-interest bodies
    > of appointed stakeholders convened for a pre-determined period of
    > time to provide advice to a decision-making body. Stakeholder
    > advisory groups can serve to identify key issues, generate
    > management alternatives, or liaise between managers and advisory
    > group constituencies. They typically have charters describing
    > their core charge and participants, and they can meet once or
    > multiple times. There are two kinds of stakeholder advisory group:

    -   Standing stakeholder advisory groups:

        i.  Typically focused on a particular fishery.

        ii. Typically meet at set intervals throughout a year.

        iii. Formalized, rotating membership.

    -   Ad hoc stakeholder advisory groups:

        i.  Typically focused on a particular policy, planning, or
            regulatory issue.

        ii. Typically convened for multiple meetings. May range from a
            few months to multiple years.

        iii. Can involve parties outside of fishing interests.

b.  *Purpose*:

    -   For either ad hoc or standing advisory groups, the purpose is to
        solicit input from a group of individuals representative of
        larger interest groups (i.e., environmental NGOs, fishing
        industry, regulators, etc.) collaboratively to support
        development of solutions to policy challenges.

c.  *Timing*:

    -   Early or late planning

    -   During ongoing program activities in anticipation of future
        policy or regulatory changes

d.  *Required resources*:

    -   Staffing: High

    -   Staffing assignments are largely dependent on the size of the
        group in question. For smaller advisory groups, a single staff
        member, one support staff, and one group facilitator may
        be sufficient. Larger groups may require additional staff to
        support group activities.

    -   Budget: High (assuming at least 4 Advisory Group meetings)

    -   Cost will depend on the number of meetings and the complexity of
        the advisory process.

    -   Third party neutral, professional facilitation is critical.

e.  *Required skills*:

    -   In depth understanding of the scientific, regulatory,
        management, and economic background of the fishery
        management issue.

    -   Facilitation and mediation experience (note: in contentious
        cases, third-party neutral facilitation is advised).

    -   Event planning or logistics support experience is beneficial.

f.  *Keys to success*:

    -   Third-party, neutral facilitation can be immensely helpful in
        achieving consensus and efficient decision-making in advisory
        group settings. This allows agency staff to focus on their role
        as fisheries managers without also trying to manage group
        dynamics or give the appearance of being allied with one side or
        another in a policy dispute.

    -   Stakeholder advisory groups can be labor intensive, relatively
        expensive, and require a significant commitment on the part of
        both fisheries managers and the stakeholder participants.
        Therefore, clear roles and commitments need to be established at
        the onset of the process to streamline engagement (e.g., with
        a Charter).

    -   For long standing advisory groups or committees, it is important
        that as stakeholder membership shifts and new members come into
        the group, they agree not to re-open previously closed
        discussions barring any significant physical or regulatory
        changes impacting the fishery. This provides the existing
        membership with assurances that existing agreements won’t be
        jeopardized if a new stakeholder joins the group.

g.  *Legal considerations*:

    -   Multiple, depending on the membership of the group. If public
        officials are seated members of the advisory group, it may be
        subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Brown
        Act, Bagley-Keene, and other “sunshine” statutes and regulation
        as described in Figure 4 above.

h.  *Evaluation*:

    -   Evaluate whether the advisory group achieved the desired policy
        outcomes in the time allotted. This can be done with mid-course
        or post-process survey evaluations.

    -   Review whether all deliverables and assignments (by staff
        and stakeholders) are completed on time and on budget.

    -   Survey participants to evaluate the fairness and efficacy of
        group facilitation and their perceptions of the process.
